    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups salsa</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can chili beans, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups tortilla chips, crushed</li>
        <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (2 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green onion</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh tomato</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gather all ingredients :</strong>Before you start cooking, measure out all ingredients. Chop the green onions and tomato, drain and rinse the beans, drain the olives, and crush the tortilla chips. Having everything ready will make the assembly process much smoother.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven and prepare the baking dish: </strong>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Set it aside while you prepare the other components.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the ground beef:</strong>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula, until it's thoroughly browned and crumbly. This should take about 8-10 minutes. If there's excess grease, carefully drain it from the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer with salsa and beans: </strong>Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the salsa. Allow the mixture to simmer gently until most of the liquid has been absorbed, which should take about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Add the drained chili beans and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they're heated through. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Layer the casserole:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>First layer: Spread the crushed tortilla chips evenly across the bottom of your prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Second layer: Spoon the beef and bean mixture over the chips, spreading it into an even layer.</li>
                <li>Third layer: Carefully spread the sour cream over the beef mixture. For easier spreading, you can dollop spoonfuls across the surface first, then gently spread them together.</li>
                <li>Fourth layer: Sprinkle the drained black olives, chopped green onion, and chopped tomato evenly over the sour cream.</li>
                <li>Fifth layer: Top everything with the shredded cheese, covering the entire surface.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the casserole:</strong>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted, bubbly, and lightly golden around the edges. The casserole should be heated all the way through.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest before serving:</strong>Remove the casserole from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set slightly, making it easier to cut and serve neat portions.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and customize:</strong>Scoop portions onto plates and serve hot. Offer optional toppings like sliced jalapeños, chopped cilantro, avocado slices, or additional sour cream on the side for everyone to customize their serving.</li>
    </ol>
