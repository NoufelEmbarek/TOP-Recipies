    <p>A creative shortcut dessert that transforms Hawaiian rolls into apple cider-filled donuts with a spiced sugar coating. </p>
    <p>These warm, sweet treats capture all the cozy flavors of autumn in an easy-to-make package.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12-count) package Hawaiian rolls</li>
        <li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>
        <li>2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix (such as Alpine Spiced Apple Cider®)</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C). Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the rolls:</strong>Separate the Hawaiian rolls and use a small knife to cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Gently widen the opening with your finger or the end of a spoon to create a pocket large enough to hold about 1 tablespoon of filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong>Roughly chop the apple pie filling into smaller pieces and place in a bowl. Stir in one packet of the apple cider drink mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the rolls:</strong>Carefully spoon about 1 tablespoon of the apple filling mixture into each prepared roll, ensuring the pocket is filled but not overstuffed.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat with butter:</strong>Melt 4 tablespoons of butter and brush each roll generously on all sides with the melted butter. Place the filled rolls on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the rolls are lightly toasted and golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the coating:</strong>While the rolls are baking, stir together the remaining packet of apple cider mix, sugar, and cinnamon in a shallow dish or plate. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the warm rolls:</strong>Once the rolls are out of the oven, immediately brush the tops with the remaining melted butter. While still warm, carefully roll each bun in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Serve warm for the best flavor and texture. These are best enjoyed the same day they're made.</li>
    </ol>
