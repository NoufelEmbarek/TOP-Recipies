    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9-inch) deep dish pie crust</li>
        <li>4 large tomatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt (for beef)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper (for beef)</li>
        <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pre-bake the Pie Crust:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Follow the directions on your pie crust package for blind baking (pre-baking a crust for a filled pie). This is essential to prevent a soggy bottom. Let it cool while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Tomatoes:</strong>This is <em> most important step </em> to avoid a watery pie. After peeling and slicing the tomatoes, lay them in a single layer on a double thickness of paper towels. Sprinkle them lightly with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes. This will draw out the excess moisture. Before assembling, gently press the tomatoes with more paper towels to soak up the liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Ground Beef:</strong>In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon. Season it with the ½ teaspoon of salt and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Cook until well-browned. <em>This is crucial: drain the beef thoroughly in a colander and then blot it with paper towels to remove all excess grease.</em> Let it cool completely.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the Pie:</strong>In your pre-baked pie crust, create layers in this order:
            <ul>
                <li>Sprinkle 1 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of the blotted-dry tomato slices.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle all of the cooked ground beef, green onions, basil, dried oregano, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper over the tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Add the final layer of tomato slices.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the Topping:</strong>In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and the mayonnaise until well combined. Spread this mixture evenly over the top layer of tomatoes, making sure to seal it to the edges of the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pie: </strong>Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips) in the preheated oven. <em>Bake for 30 minutes.</em> Then, continue baking for another 20-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong>Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool and set for at least 20-30 minutes before slicing. This waiting time is key for a clean slice. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
